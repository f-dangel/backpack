BackPACK is built on top of [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). It efficiently computes quantities other than the gradient.

- **Website:** https://backpack.pt
- **Documentation:** https://docs.backpack.pt/en/master/
- **Bug reports & feature requests:** https://github.com/f-dangel/backpack/issues

Provided quantities include:
- Individual gradients from a mini-batch
- Estimates of the gradient variance or second moment
- Approximate second-order information (diagonal and Kronecker approximations)

**Motivation:** Computation of most quantities is not necessarily expensive (often just a small modification of the existing backward pass where backpropagated information can be reused). But it is difficult to do in the current software environment.


## Installation
```bash
pip install backpack-for-pytorch
```
