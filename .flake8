# Differences with pytorch
#
# 	Smaller max-line-length
# 	Enabled max-complexity
#	No flake8-mypy (T4 range)
#
# Set of rules ignore by pytorch, probably to get around the C
#
#	F401 (import unused in __init__.py) not ignored
#   F403 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#   F405 Name may be undefined, or defined from star imports: module
#   F821 Undefined name name
#   F841 Local variable name is assigned to but never used
#
# Pytorch ignored rules that I don't see a reason to ignore (yet?):
#
#   E305 Expected 2 blank lines after end of function or class
#   E402 Module level import not at top of file
#   E721 Do not compare types, use 'isinstance()'
#   E741 Do not use variables named 'l', 'o', or 'i'
#   E302 Expected 2 blank lines, found 0
#	E303 Too many blank lines (3)
