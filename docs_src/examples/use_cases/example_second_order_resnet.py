r"""Second order extensions with a ResNet
========================================

In this example we explain how you can compute second-order information with BackPACK on
models that exhibit branching in the forward pass, one popular class being ResNets.

To tell BackPACK that your model is branched, you will have to use a built-in module
class, instead of writing the forward pass manually.

# %%
# Notice how it is important for second-order extensions to leave the forward pass
# untouched.
#
# .. note:
#    It is currently not possible to use PyTorch's built-in identity module
#    :py:class:`torch.nn.Identity` and instead one has to use BackPACK's
#    :py:class:`ActiveIdentity<backpack.branching.ActiveIdentity>`. The reasons for that
#    are technical: :py:class:`torch.nn.Identity` does not create a new operation in the
#    computation graph. This leads to an unexpected order in which the hooks, that
#    backpropagate information for second-order extensions, are executed.
#
#    The problem is known to the PyTorch developers, and they will resolve this issue
#    in future releases. For now, you need to use
#    :py:class:`ActiveIdentity<backpack.branching.ActiveIdentity>`, which acts like
#    PyTorch's identity, but fixes the backward hook execution order by inserting a new
#    node into the graph during a forward pass.
#
# Let's create and extend our ResNet model, as well as a loss function module:

model = extend(make_resnet()).to(DEVICE)
lossfunc = extend(torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction="mean")).to(DEVICE)
